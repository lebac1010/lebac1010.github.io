In 1896. a new newspaper was produced in large numbers and at such low prices that ordinary people could buy it on every street corner, and it was an instant success. <em>The Daily Mail<\/em>, which is still running today, was the mother of the modern tabloid. and the beginning of a whole new subculture in the British press. Today more than twice as many tabloids are sold than the so-called &#39;quality press&#39; titles such as <em>The Times<\/em> or <em>The Guardian<\/em>.<\/p>  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp; Originally, the word <em>tabloid<\/em> referred to the size and format. But today, for most people, the word <em>tabloid<\/em> has nothing to do with shape and size. What makes a tabloid a tabloid is content, and above all, style. Tabloids follow a special <strong><u>formula<\/u><\/strong>; they report the news, but only certain kinds. Tabloids dedicate most of their pages to stories about celebrities. This involves photographing them in embarrassing situations, gossiping about their private lives and generally making them look a bit silly. However, the tabloids are not simply an irritation for celebrities; they are also <strong><u>a vehicle<\/u><\/strong> for self-promotion.<\/p>  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp; Though they have millions of devoted readers, tabloids are also widely criticised in Britain. They are accused of being sensationalist, in bad taste, and of having no ethical standards in their reporting and &lsquo;researching&rsquo; methods. <strong><u>They<\/u><\/strong> may tap celebrities&rsquo; phones or even break into their houses just to get a story. When criticised, the tabloids state that the public has a right to know about everything, but celebrities have no rights to privacy at all.<\/p>  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp; So why does Britain, which has access to the best press agencies and the highest journalistic standards, consume tabloids like chocolate? Maybe the reason is that we have enough news on the television, the radio and in the quality newspapers. Tabloids are not actually about news at all. Tabloids are just about gossip. And when it comes to gossip, what matters is not what is true or what is kind, but what is entertaining and what is funny. The more in bad taste a story is, the funnier it seems. And bad taste is what the British tabloids have made into an art.<\/p>  <p style=\"text-align:right\">(Adapted from <strong><em>Oxford Exam Excellence<\/em><\/strong>&rdquo; by Dannula Gryca et al.)<\/p>","items":[{"question":"<p><strong>Question 43<\/strong>:&nbsp; <em>Which best serves as the title for the passage<\/em>?<\/p>","answers":["The Guardian: Feeding Bad Taste for Gossip","The Art of Bad Taste: The British Tabloid","Tabloids: Too Kind to Be True","Tabloids versus Broadsheets: An Ongoing War"],"key":1,"explain":"Qua qu\u00e1 tr\u00ecnh \u0111\u1ecdc l\u01b0\u1edbt qua \u0111o\u1ea1n tr\u00edch tr\u00ean, ta c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 th\u1ea5y \u0111o\u1ea1n tr\u00edch kh\u00f4ng n\u00f3i ri\u00eang v\u1ec1 t\u1edd Guardian (The Guardian), c\u0169ng kh\u00f4ng so s\u00e1nh v\u1ec1 b\u00e1o ch\u00ednh th\u1ed1ng v\u00e0 b\u00e1o l\u00e1 c\u1ea3i (Tabloids versus Broadsheets) m\u00e0 n\u1ed9i dung n\u00f3i chung v\u1ec1 th\u1ec3 lo\u1ea1i b\u00e1o l\u00e1 c\u1ea3i c\u00f9ng ch\u1ec9 tr\u00edch v\u1ec1 nh\u1eefng ch\u1ee7 \u0111\u1ec1 c\u1ee7a n\u00f3.
